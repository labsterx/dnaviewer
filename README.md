Browser Based Viewer of DNA, inplemented by LabsterX.

## Introduction
This repository implements a very simple single page application (SPA) that renders a diagram
and table given some JSON data about a piece of DNA. DNA sequences have particular subsegments that have a special
function. These are called DNA Features. The goal is to show a scientist the Dna Features in a particular DNA
molecule. One way of doing this is with a set of symbols called Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual).

A quick Google Search for "Plasmid Diagram" (plasmids are a type of circular DNA molecule) will show you many different
designs.
